# Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview
This project focuses on designing web infrastructures for hosting websites, emphasizing concepts like DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to understand and explain these components without relying on external resources, showcasing knowledge of system redundancy and key acronyms like LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Concepts Covered
- DNS
- Monitoring
- Web Server
- Network basics
- Load balancer
- Server

## Learning Objectives
- Draw a diagram covering the web stack with SysAdmin/DevOps track projects
- Explain the purpose of each component
- Understand system redundancy
- Acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements
- README.md file is mandatory
- Whiteboard diagrams for each task
- Manual review for each task completion
- Uploading screenshots of completed tasks
- Whiteboarding each task without computer or notes

## Tasks
1. **Simple Web Stack**: Design a single-server web infrastructure with a LAMP stack, accessible via www.foobar.com. Include explanations for each component and identify potential issues like SPOF and downtime during maintenance.

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**: Design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, including load balancer, application server, and MySQL database. Explain the rationale for each addition and discuss issues like SPOF and security vulnerabilities.

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**: Design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com with enhanced security, encrypted traffic, and monitoring. Include firewalls, SSL certificate, and monitoring clients. Discuss the significance of each addition and address issues such as SSL termination, single MySQL server for writes, and server uniformity.
