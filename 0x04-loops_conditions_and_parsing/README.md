## About Bash Projects
Unless stated, all projects will be auto-corrected with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Background Context
This project focuses on loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting.

## Resources

- Loops sample
- Variable assignment and arithmetic
- Comparison operators
- File test operators
- Make your scripts portable

Man or Help:
- env
- cut
- for
- while
- until
- if

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain without external help:
- How to create SSH keys
- Advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- Usage of while, until, and for loops
- Usage of if, else, elif, and case condition statements
- Application of the cut command
- Understanding of files and other comparison operators

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files end with a new line
- README.md file at the project root is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- No use of awk
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors
- First line of Bash scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line: Comment explaining the script's purpose

## More Info
- Shellcheck is recommended for syntax and semantics checking
